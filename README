INTRODUCTION
============

This module acts as a Perl5 interface to the LDAP C Development Kits from
University of Michigan and Netscape.  The module itself is written completely
in C. Full documentation is included, as are commented example scripts. 

Version 1.31 includes patches from Hallvard B. Furuseth
<h.b.furuseth@usit.uio.no> to work with the ISODE libraries and includes.

REQUIREMENTS
============

This module requires Perl5, a C compiler, and the LDAP libraries and include
files from either of the following: 

Netscape LDAP C SDK (used by author): 
    http://developer.netscape.com/one/directory/downloads.html 
University of Michigan LDAP-3.3: 
    ftp://terminator.rs.itd.umich.edu/ldap/ldap-3.3.tar.Z 

It may also works with the ISODE libraries and includes.


PLATFORMS SUPPORTED
===================

This version should be easily compiled on various platforms. It has be tested
extensively under Solaris and verified to work under HPUX 10. 

Please let me know if you compile it successfully on a new platform or have
any problems. For problems, please include the compilation errors. 


INSTALLATION
============

   After extracting the archive, simply type the following:

      $ perl5 Makefile.PL
      $ make

   Edit the file test.pl to contain your LDAP server, BASEDN, and filter
string.  Next type:

      $ make test

   It should complete all of its tests with no problems.  To install the
module you will likely need to become root and type:

      # make install

   That's it.  You can now 'use Net::LDAPapi' and make LDAP calls within your
PERL5 scripts with ease.


EXAMPLES
========

   There exists three examples in the 'examples' directory.  I'll probably
include a full-featured LDAP Maintenance CGI at some point in the near
future.  The current examples are:

      o ldapwalk.pl - This script demonstrates the use of Asynchronous LDAP
         calls to return all the attributes and values for entries matching
         a filter specified on the command line.  Simply change the variables
         at the start of the file to match your environment.

      o testwrite.pl - This script demonstrates using synchronous Add, Modify,
         and Delete calls to manage an LDAP server.  You need update access
         to an LDAP server to run this example.  Once again, simply change
         the variables at the top of the file.

      o www-ldap.pl - This script uses both this module and the CGI.pm
         module available on the Internet.  It allows users to authenticate
         and modify their own information.  You can easily customize this
         program, or learn from it and write your own CGIs.  The BIND
         and WEB_AUTHENTICATE subroutines would be especially useful in
         incorporating LDAP authentication into your own CGI scripts, even
         if the script has nothing to do with LDAP otherwise.

   In addition, the test.pl program in the top level directory shows some
of the basic synchronous search functionality.


LDAP API SUPPORT
================

   The following is a list of LDAP API calls supported by this API.  You can
find more information on each one in the man page generated when you make
the module.

FEEDBACK
========

I'm looking for any feedback regarding this package or how you use this
package.  If you've got other good examples or such, please send them my
way and I'll include them.

BUGS
====

Lots of things have been cleaned up in this release, especially the
add/modify routines and memory management.

Changes may mean bugs, but I haven't found any yet.  Drop me a line if
you find anything.
